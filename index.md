      I am a Korean-Canadian freelance journalist, writer, editor, fact-checker and poet based in Brooklyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently I completed a reporting fellowship with The New York Times, reporting stories on mental and physical health and wellness for the Well desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journalism can be found in The Atlantic, Vox, Scientific American, The Guardian, and Catapult (RIP), among others. Common topics of interest include neuroscience/psychology, ocean ecology, the intersection of climate and mental health, and social science.

    <p>
      When I'm not writing articles, I'm working on essays or poetry. My poetry has been featured in The New Limestone Review, Portland Review, Barzakh Magazine, and The Broadkill Review, among others; and I'm currently working toward my first collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently available for writing and editing assignments, as well as fact-checking work. Please get in touch!
