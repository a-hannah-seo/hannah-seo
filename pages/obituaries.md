    <h2>Let me help you honor the life of your loved one with a specially crafted obituary.</h2>
    <p>I've had the honor of writing numerous obituaries for grieving families searching for a way to tell their loved one's life story. </p>

    <p>Nothing is worse than a bland obituary that fails to convey the unique and lively colors of a life once lived. With every obituary, I strive to get to every individual's essence, and to convey their life and personality with the love and vibrancy that their loved ones would like to remember them by. 
    
    Whether you're seeking an obituary for a parent, spouse, or even for yourself (i.e. a living obituary), I will craft a unique narrative obituary that captures their personality and essence that honors their life. </p>

    <h3>How hiring me as an obituary writer will work. </h3>
    <p>You'll get in touch, telling me who the obituary is for, and how fast you need it. My contact info is linked at the top of the page.</p>
    
    <p>From there we'll schedule a time for a 30 minute phone call. During this chat you'll tell me all about your loved one's life, their personality, and any important details or anecdotes that capture their essence and arc of life. I'll send you a fully written obituary within about a week of our call.</p> 
    
    <p>After you've received my drafted obituary, you'll hav ethe opportunity to provide me with feedback and any edits you'd like to make. Once you're happy with the finished product, we can proceed with payment of <strong>$300</strong>, payable by Zelle or Venmo.</p>
    
    <p>Recounting the life of a loved one is difficult, but I hope to make this process as gentle and joyful as possible. </p>
